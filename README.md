🎯  Problem Statement: EV Data Analysis and Chatbot Development

**Problem**:
The rapid expansion of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market demands fast, accurate, and accessible insights. However, raw EV datasets are often noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete—making it difficult to extract reliable information and build predictive models.

**Objective**:
To develop a robust data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline that transforms unstructured EV data into a structured, high-quality dataset, enabling meaningful analysis and machine learning applications.

**Goal**:
To integrate the cleaned EV dataset with an AI-powered conversational chatbot, allowing users to interactively explore EV performance, pricing, and efficiency insights—simplifying data-driven decision-making for manufacturers, analysts, and consumers.

### 🧠 Week-1: EV Chatbot & Vehicle Data Analysis

#### 📋 Project Overview

The rapid growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry makes analyzing performance, specifications, and market trends essential for manufacturers, analysts, and consumers. However, raw data is often inconsistent, unstructured, or incomplete, hindering effective analysis and forecasting.

This repository details a project with two primary components:

1.  *Chatbot Development:* A conversational chatbot prototype for EV-related interactions.
2.  *EV Data Analysis:* The preprocessing, cleaning, and exploration of an electric vehicle dataset to derive actionable insights.

The ultimate goal is to combine conversational AI with data analytics to effectively understand and communicate trends within the EV industry.
